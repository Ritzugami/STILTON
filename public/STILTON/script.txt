#Welcome to the STILTON script! This is where the magic happens.
#All lines prefixed with a hash (#) are ignored (i.e. commented).
#This is where you'll control the flow of your game.
#The most important things to remember:

#Lines prefixed with a dollar sign ($) are commands.
#a line with a character ID, then a colon, note "say" blocks, which is how characters say things.
