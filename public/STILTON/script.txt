#Welcome to the STILTON script! This is where the magic happens.
#All lines prefixed with a hash (#) are ignored (i.e. commented).
#This is where you'll control the flow of your game.
#The most important things to remember:

#Lines prefixed with a dollar sign ($) are commands. They are executed instantly when called, and afterwards STILTON will read the following line without waiting for user input. 
#a line with a character ID, then a colon, note "say" blocks, which is how characters say things.
