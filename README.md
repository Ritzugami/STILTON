# STILTON
STILTON (Simple Text and Image Language for Typing Online Novels) is currently an idea. Based of the concept of Ren'py, STILTON is to be a ultra-simplified way of creating a text-based "game", lightweight and natively deployable in browsers. STILTON, as a language, should be stupidly easy to read and write- easy enough to learn and deploy in minutes.
